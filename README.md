# Flashy Flashcards ðŸ“š

Flashy is a simple Python application built with tkinter and pandas to help you learn and remember new words or phrases in a fun and interactive way. It's like digital flashcards that you can use for language learning or any other educational purposes.

## Features

âœ¨ Randomly display words or phrases from a CSV file.
âœ¨ Flip cards to reveal the translation.
âœ¨ Mark words as "known" to remove them from the learning list.
âœ¨ Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI).

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

1. Python installed on your computer.
2. Required Python packages: tkinter, pandas.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary Python packages if you haven't already:
   - pip install tkinter pandas
3. Run the Flashy application using the following command:
   - python main.py

## Usage

- When you run the application, it will display a word or phrase in one language.
- Click on the card to flip it and reveal the translation in another language.
- If you know the translation, click the "Known" button to remove the word from the learning list.
- If you're unsure or don't know the translation, click the "Unknown" button to continue learning.

## Customization

You can customize the Flashy application by modifying the CSV files and images in the `data` and `images` directories. Update the CSV files with your own words and translations.

## Future Updates

We have exciting plans for future updates to make Flashy even better:

âœ… Support for multiple language pairs.
âœ… Progress tracking and statistics.
âœ… Import/export features to share your word lists.
